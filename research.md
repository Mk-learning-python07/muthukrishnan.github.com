# Exploring Direct Air Capture as a means of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Technology for decarbonization

## **Research Objective**

The objective of this research is to investigate and optimize **Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA)** cycles for **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** applications, with a primary focus on process simulation, sorbent characterization, and the design of experimental setups. This research aims to improve CO₂ removal efficiency using **Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs)** as sorbent materials, which are advantageous for DAC applications due to their potential for high adsorption capacities.

<!-- ### Phase 1: Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)

The initial phase of the study will involve **Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)** to assess the CO2 loading characteristics of various MOFs. This will provide valuable insights into the adsorption capacities and thermal stability of the materials under varying conditions. The TGA data will help determine the sorbents' suitability for PSA-based DAC processes by evaluating their CO2 uptake and performance at different temperatures and pressures.

### Phase 2: Dynamic Column Breakthrough (DCB) Experiments

Following the TGA analysis, **Dynamic Column Breakthrough (DCB)** experiments will be conducted to examine the adsorption behavior and cyclic performance of the selected MOFs in more detail. These experiments are crucial for identifying optimal operating conditions for the PSA cycles, including pressure, temperature, and flow rate, which significantly influence process efficiency, CO2 recovery, and sorbent longevity.

### Challenges with Transience in PSA Processes

A major challenge in PSA processes lies in the **transience** of the adsorption cycles—during the cyclic operation, there are sharp fluctuations in pressure, temperature, and sorbent loadings, which complicates the prediction and optimization of system behavior. The transition between adsorption and desorption phases can lead to inefficiencies, particularly if the system is not perfectly optimized. These transient effects can cause delays in reaching steady-state conditions, resulting in suboptimal CO2 capture rates and energy consumption. Addressing these challenges requires accurate modeling and simulations, along with careful experimental design to account for transient behavior and optimize the timing of cycle steps.

### Phase 3: Process Demonstration Unit (PDU)

Once the sorbent performance is characterized through TGA and DCB experiments, a **Process Demonstration Unit (PDU)** will be employed to simulate and evaluate the PSA cycles under practical operating conditions. The PDU will allow for real-time monitoring of system performance and the impact of varying cycle parameters, such as cycle time, pressure, and temperature, on both the adsorption and desorption steps. Special attention will be given to the transient phases of the process, which are critical for optimizing the overall system efficiency and ensuring smooth cycle transitions. The objective is to refine the PSA cycles by minimizing the impact of transient behavior and enhancing the scalability of the DAC process for large-scale CO2 removal.

### Conclusion

This research will contribute to the development of more efficient and reliable PSA-based DAC systems, providing insights into the optimization of process parameters and sorbent characteristics. The findings will help address the challenges associated with transience in the adsorption cycles, ultimately advancing DAC technologies and supporting efforts to mitigate global carbon emissions and combat climate change.
